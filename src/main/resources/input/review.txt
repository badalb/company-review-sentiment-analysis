I have been working at AppDirect full-time
A good company to work with! They are setting-up a team like anything, all are giving their 100% to buildup a good team.

Management/HR/Support, all are very humble and helpful. Of course! I recommend AppDirect without hesitation.
I think it will take some time to rectify the Cons :)
You guys are doing good! Keep up the great work!

Work environment
Work life balance.
Startup Lean culture.
Pays well as per market standard.
Nothing really , just maintain the momentum.
Keep following the startup/Lean culture.
So far it has been going really well.
Keep up the good work.
I worked at AppDirect full-time (More than a year)the brightest, exceptionally high-skilled and talented software engineers
- entertaining and fun social events, including wine club and game nights
- best in class foosball table (and players, huh)
- pretty convenient location in beautiful Old Port area
- huge potential to become the best place to work but .…

one guy to rule them all: the decision making process is terrible
- top to bottom style: no one listens for engineers and take into account their opinions
- tech debt stacks for ages: the imposed culture of making shortcuts and fix them later (== never)
- no product thinking: the platform is enourmous pile of ad-hoc customizations
- bug fixing makes 90% of your day
- trust your talent: let the engineers to take care of technology, focus on business
- don't trade talent for cheap labour: the engineers you have now is your most precious and valuable asset
- build product, not a monster with many faces

Great office
Fun and friendly atmosphere
Talented experienced engineers
Nice swags
Engineering organization and practices are archaic and counterproductive.
Non debatable top-to-bottom approach that demotivates/frustrates the entire organization and shirks individuals from their responsibilities as SW engineers.
SW design decisions are taken by a small group of engineers in CEO's inner circle who have little to no experience/interest in building quality and scalable SW platforms. Focus is on …
None. They would just not listen... for they know better.

Peoples are amazing! You will make friends.
Technical knowledge is very good, engineers are mature and experienced.
Opportunity to work with the hardware of you choice
Offices have all their own flavours of pros and it goes around things like :
 - lots of board games, ping-pong, foosball, pool, ps4, game nights, etc.
 - collations, nice location for restaurants too
 - coffee, beers, wine, sparkling water, etc.
 - amazing office managers
 - open space
Office team lunches every weeks, sometimes more often
Organised events are glamorous
Very good work/life Balance with flexible schedule and possibility to work from home
Peoples you work with are amazing, did I said that twice?
AppDirect is not an shinny engineering heaven; it's driven by features, decisions are top-bottom while "yes men" juggle with priorities

There is code frustration, recognition is low or null.
"Challenging environment" translate to having technical debts.
"Working in a startup environment" translates to being disorganised and having zero consistency across our monolithic project.
Meetings serve more as an attendance confirmation than actual planning.
We don't measure, we aren't given to opportunity to.
Hey hi, it's me, another Glassdoor review. Feels like a deja-vu?

Some things have been said so many times and, yet, actions taken don't reflect a management that care about solving them.

But let's give it a try with different words; here goes the song :

 you've hired experienced professionals, please listen to them
 get to know your peoples, so you can use their potential accordingly
 get to understand what's going on, technical debt is not a myth
 yes, overall company is doing well, doesn't mean there is no room for improvement

 * guitar solo *

 considerable time and effort is lost on debating the engineering priorities.
 so why we can't actually go the direction that was openly discussed.
 we hear about greatness, visions and values
 while we don't see them embraced in the engineering structure.

Well, there is a lot of room for improving. I would suggest less involvement from CEO into designing UX while there is a whole team dedicated to this, this doesn't scale well and prevent addressing other critical points.

Also, please consider engineers output in decisions making. Software engineers are not challenging the way AppDirect is managed in other spheres but they have knowledge to share on the technical aspect. Their knowledge, vision and experience should be taken into consideration since AppDirect's main product is all about software and engineering.

On another note, you're doing very good in terms of sells, market strategy and business relations:
No matter how things can be bad in engineering, company will always survive.
But... it could be better by acknowledging the current situation and needs, letting peoples shine were they excel and openly doing retrospective on the ways engineering is managed.

Great people. Great office. Great views. There are, of course, rough patches as with any scaling company, but it feels like many of those things are finally being discussed and addressed.
With so many moving parts, there are times where it feels like the cross-functional communication is lacking. Leadership team seems to be working hard to address this, with the help of a newly robust People Operations team.
Keep doing your best to keep your employees happy and engaged. Communication goes a long way!

- Flexible schedule
- Free snacks and beverages, catered lunch on Fridays
- Friendly atmosphere and decent amount of social events
- Smart, yet underutilized, team members
- The lack of incentives to be a long-term or loyal employee is comical. There isn't even the semblance of a dangling carrot. CEOs literally think we should all be eternally grateful for getting to work at AppDirect.
- If you have a problem with anything related to the company, you are led to believe it's a problem with you, not them.
- Constructive criticism that makes the company look even slightly bad is NOT encouraged. Don't even think about complaining or you will be pegged as a rabble-rouser by HR.
- Almost zero potential for promotions, raises or bonuses. Raises capped at 4% no matter what.
- Much like high school, there are severe distinctions between the inner circle and everyone else. Engineers are more or less ignored while the sales team gets expensive offsites, dinners, and recognition. CEOs have their 'favorites' that get fast-tracked to managerial positions that they are 100% not qualified for.
- Monthly town hall is basically an opportunity for leadership to toot their own horns and repeat the same propaganda over and over.
- Huge focus on company values that are not exemplified by leadership.
- Zero mentorship possibility here. There is no one to learn from given that there is a serious lack of director/VP level staff.
Advice to Management
- Learn to have some emotional distance between yourself and the company; it will make you less defensive when people criticize and will enable you to delegate.
- Stop micromanaging! You do not have the bandwidth to have your hands in every project that's happening here.
- Encourage career growth instead of keeping people stuck in the same position for years on end.
- Acknowledgement that you are very difficult to work with goes a long way; you should try it sometime!

- Working with very smart, talented and exceptional people.
- Friendly atmosphere and good events that brings the team together.
- Great office and good perks Silicon Valley style. Fridge is full and there is a foosball table. All that kind of stuff!
- Good salary but it depends on how well you negotiate at the beginning.
- Great customers with big names.
- Very talented employees but almost all under utilized and undervalued. Engineering is undervalued compared to business and growth.
- You are likely not going to learn anything new or work on anything interesting if you are already a seasoned engineer. If you don't immediately need money ask for a tour of the code base, take your time and evaluate then decide. Pretty much like any other job !
- If you are a junior engineer I recommend you start somewhere you can learn good engineering practices. or make sure to allocate sometime to read and contribute to open source and pick up clean code to learn something other than if-driven development.
- Recognition and raises are terrible.
- YES men are running the show from a closed circle of 'expert beginners'. If you don't know the this 'term', search for "Rise of the expert beginner" and try hard to not become one if you decide to take a job at AppDirect.
- Townhalls are just a Void and their sole function is to help with the egos of executives.
- Executives live in a bubble. Work is not engineering focused and engineering issues are not seen or addressed.
- People who have never been coding find it appropriate to have strong opinion on and/or make technical decisions.


-Great team
-Great work environnement
-Good salary
-Free snacks and free lunch Thursday
Hope to have more internship there !
Make teams able to bring their interns in SF

You come to work to work alongside really smart, talented people. Friendliest folks around and it's really easy to build relationships.
-Those talented people are under utilized.

-Culture sucks. We take a culture survey and I'm pretty sure they try to figure out who wrote what. We were told that if you write something negative then you should just leave the company.

-Micro management at CEO level.

-Terrible recognition and raises.

-Townhall doesn't tell you anything...repeated stuff over and over and no one can tell you after what the true health of the company is.

-Not great benefits.

-Diversity not a focus.

-Brain drain...good people are leaving.
-Stop micromanaging. You hired smart, experienced people let them do their jobs and take them seriously.

-Be more culture focused. Practice what you say you'll do. The people with the least humility are the executive level. But they sure do a good job making other people feel humility.

-Be more positive around culture in town halls, don't tell people to leave.

-Be transparent.

-CEOs should not build cliques around themselves.

-Diversify team.

Work and Life Balance, Great Talent
You should listen to the opinions of your employees and acknowledge that no one in the company is too "low on the totem pole" to receive constructive criticism from. You've hired intelligent, talented people: acknowledge them, reward them and encourage their career growth rather than smother them. Practice what you preach.

Open work environment, always exciting challenges, and a company who's growth is off the charts. What a ride it's been!
It's an incredible company with great growth, but that comes with hard work. Been ready to be challenged.

I have been working at AppDirect (More than a year)
AppDirect has a very broad product offering and has grown rapidly with some very big customer wins as well as acquisitions. Very interesting and unique platform. Very positive culture. Amazing HQ office in downtown SF.
Rapid growth (also a pro) has resulted in some gaps in processes especially around training and communications. Still very much a startup in many ways despite having over 500 employees.
Operational improvements are needed to continue to scale, would continue to hire Senior Exec leadership with track records of scaling companies.

- All the awesome SF-startup perks only that it's in Montreal
- Travel twice a year to visit SF offices
- Salaries way above the average for the Montreal area
- Workload and quality of tasks varies a LOT from each team, many teams just fixes bugs all day
